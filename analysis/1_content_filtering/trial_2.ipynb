How CNET chose the best internet providers in Las Cruces. . Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What’s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.. . It doesn’t end there: We go to the FCC’s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP’s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.. . Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:. . Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they’re paying? Are customers happy with their service?. . While the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.). . To explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.. . What's the final word on internet providers in Las Cruces?. . Your home broadband options will be limited if you reside in Las Cruces. Most households in the city are serviceable for a cable connection from Xfinity. Like most cable providers, expect a price hike from Xfinity once the promo period ends. A fixed wireless connection from T-Mobile might be a decent alternative to avoid that increase. Starlink is available virtually everywhere, but you might have to settle for slower speeds and a steeper monthly cost (to say nothing of the $349 upfront cost for starting service).. . Internet providers in Las Cruces FAQs. . What is the best internet service provider in Las Cruces? Xfinity is the best internet service provider in Las Cruces, offering the city's fastest speeds, broadest coverage and lowest introductory prices. According to the latest data from the FCC, Xfinity is available to over 99% of households in Las Cruces, which means that your address is likely eligible for service.. . Is fiber internet available in Las Cruces? Yes, according to the latest FCC data, fiber internet is available to approximately 4% of Las Cruces households. Fiber coverage is limited throughout the city, but few households might be serviceable for Quantum Fiber or Xfinity's fiber internet connection.. . What is the cheapest internet provider in Las Cruces? Xfinity is the cheapest internet provider in Las Cruces, offering a $20-a-month plan for 150Mbps. For just $15 more, you can bump up that speed to 300Mbps.\""

       "'Nature’s 2023 survey of postdoctoral researchers identified a notable gap between industry and academia. Although industry postdocs remain in the minority — only 7% of the 3,838 respondents from around the world reported working in an industrial setting — they reported greater satisfaction and tended to be better compensated. Nearly one-quarter of postdocs in industry reported annual earnings of between US$80,000 and $110,000, compared with just 5% of their academic counterparts.. . Whereas global companies such as Google, Honda and Coca-Cola all have postdocs on the payroll, it is pharmaceutical and life-science companies that have been especially eager to embrace this group as part of their workforce. AstraZeneca, for example, employs more than 120 postdocs in 3-year positions across its research and design centres in the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Industry postdocs can learn fresh skills and explore new scientific targets — with some corporate restrictions — and the companies get eager workers who can make important advances in basic science.. . Nature spoke to three postdocs who work at large pharmaceutical and life-science companies: Genentech, Merck and AstraZeneca. Although the transition from academia to industry isn’t always easy, and the next step isn’t always apparent, all agree that these positions provided invaluable experience.. . ANNIE WOOLVEN: Big company, big opportunities. . Systems biologist at AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK.. . Annie Woolven says a postdoc at AstraZeneca has opened the door to new opportunities.Credit: AstraZeneca. . During graduate school at the University of Birmingham, UK, I used analytical chemistry to study metabolomics and metabolism. Among other things, I looked at metabolites in human tears.. . That work was interesting, but I never really felt that academia was right for me. Teaching, grant writing, managing other people — there was a lot that wasn’t related to science. I hadn’t necessarily planned to do a postdoc position, but I came across this project at AstraZeneca in Cambridge, UK, that really spoke to me. Because it involved moving from metabolomics to systems biology, I knew that I would gain many new skills. And it would let me see if industry was a good place to do my science.. . Planning a postdoc before moving to industry? Think again. . As a postdoc in the clinical pharmacology and safety sciences division, I’m not involved with pipeline work. AstraZeneca expects us to publish at least two articles in high-quality publications during our time here, so everything has to be releasable to the public. I’m on track to meet those expectations. I have one draft in the works, and I’ll start another paper after I finish some data analysis.. . There are advantages to working in a large company. I can learn from people in different parts of the firm; we have Friday talks where in-house researchers from all around the business discuss their projects. But it’s not just about research. People come here to talk about law, policy and entrepreneurship. I’m personally becoming interested in science communication. I know the communications team would answer my questions and help me to explore that career option. If there’s another part of the company that I think is more interesting, I could just get a coffee with someone. I don’t think that could happen in academia.. . I led the start up of a focus group of people who work in multi-omics in AstraZeneca. At first it was just postdocs, but it now includes people with other positions in the company. We also invite academics to talk about their multi-omics work. At any stage of your career, building those sorts of network can be helpful.. . I’m well-funded and taken care of. I have support when I need it throughout the company, and I’m able to focus on just my research. I have a standard working week. After working practically 24/7 on my PhD thesis, it’s a welcome change of pace.. . My three-year contract ends in April 2025. I’m not sure where I’ll be next, but I want to stay in industry. For me, a postdoctoral position outside academia was definitely the right choice.. . JOE PARRY: Building a fresh toolkit. . Organic chemist at Merck, Rahway, New Jersey.. . Joe Parry has become interested in process chemistry during his postdoc at Merck.Credit: Merck Sharp & Dohme. . Near the end of my time in graduate school at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, I started craving a change in environment. Up until that point, I had only really known life in academia, where I studied organometallic chemistry. I thought that trying something different would be a great opportunity to stretch myself, personally and professionally. It was the first time in my life that I didn’t have the next several years completely mapped out, which was scary.. . I saw that Merck was offering a postdoc position in Rahway, New Jersey, that was loosely related to some of the skills that I had developed at graduate school. I could tell that there was potential for me to gain skill sets. I had never used an ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry machine until I started at Merck. Now it’s a standard tool for my research. The chance to explore different ways to tackle problems was exciting to me. When I reflect on my day-to-day life now, it looks completely different from two years ago.. . Postdocs are organizing to obtain better pay and working conditions — that can only be a good thing. . During my two years at Merck, I’ve become interested in process chemistry, which involves finding practical and efficient ways to produce newly discovered compounds. Using high-throughput experimentation, I can develop innovative approaches to tough problems in chemistry. I hope to continue exploring process chemistry in my next position, hopefully in industry.. . I value the community and collaborative environment at Merck. Postdocs here are embedded in research teams, and there’s no project that’s off limits. Postdocs are often given exploratory projects with the hope that the methods they develop will eventually be helpful for developing profitable pharmaceuticals and other compounds.. . There’s a misconception that postdocs in industry aren’t able to publish papers, because they’re too busy working on company secrets. In fact, we’re encouraged to publish. Merck recognizes that publishing our work helps to facilitate exchanges with outside researchers and is important for our career development. I have a couple of manuscripts in the works, but it’s too early to discuss the details.'"

       " ' Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What’s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov',\n",
       " ' . It doesn’t end there: We go to the FCC’s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP’s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication',\n",
       " ' . Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:',\n",
       " ' Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they’re paying? Are customers happy with their service?',\n",
       " ' While the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)',\n",

Like most cable providers, expect a price hike from Xfinity once the promo period ends. A fixed wireless connection from T-Mobile might be a decent alternative to avoid that increase.

       "['Nature’s 2023 survey of postdoctoral researchers identified a notable gap between industry and academia. Although industry postdocs remain in the minority — only 7% of the 3,838 respondents from around the world reported working in an industrial setting — they reported greater satisfaction and tended to be better compensated. Nearly one-quarter of postdocs in industry reported annual earnings of between US$80,000 and $110,000, compared with just 5% of their academic counterparts',\n",
       " ' . Whereas global companies such as Google, Honda and Coca-Cola all have postdocs on the payroll, it is pharmaceutical and life-science companies that have been especially eager to embrace this group as part of their workforce. AstraZeneca, for example, employs more than 120 postdocs in 3-year positions across its research and design centres in the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Industry postdocs can learn fresh skills and explore new scientific targets — with some corporate restrictions — and the companies get eager workers who can make important advances in basic science',\n",
       " ' . Nature spoke to three postdocs who work at large pharmaceutical and life-science companies: Genentech, Merck and AstraZeneca.

I hadn’t necessarily planned to do a postdoc position, but I came across this project at AstraZeneca in Cambridge, UK, that really spoke to me. Because it involved moving from metabolomics to systems biology, I knew that I would gain many new skills. And it would let me see if industry was a good place to do my science',\n",

       " ' As a postdoc in the clinical pharmacology and safety sciences division, I’m not involved with pipeline work.

I have one draft in the works, and I’ll start another paper after I finish some data analysis',\n",
       " ' . There are advantages to working in a large company. I can learn from people in different parts of the firm; we have Friday talks where in-house researchers from all around the business discuss their projects. But it’s not just about research. People come here to talk about law, policy and entrepreneurship. I’m personally becoming interested in science communication. I know the communications team would answer my questions and help me to explore that career option. If there’s another part of the company that I think is more interesting, I could just get a coffee with someone. I don’t think that could happen in academia',\n",
       " ' . I led the start up of a focus group of people who work in multi-omics in AstraZeneca. At first it was just postdocs, but it now includes people with other positions in the company.

Up until that point, I had only really known life in academia, where I studied organometallic chemistry. I thought that trying something different would be a great opportunity to stretch myself, personally and professionally. It was the first time in my life that I didn’t have the next several years completely mapped out, which was scary',\n",

I could tell that there was potential for me to gain skill sets. I had never used an ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry machine until I started at Merck. Now it’s a standard tool for my research. The chance to explore different ways to tackle problems was exciting to me.

Despite the difference in their appearance, Pajitnov, pale with a white beard, and Rogers, tan with a colorful trilby, make a formidable team who overcame great odds to bring their puzzle game – in which players pair and eliminate a series of multicolored falling blocks – to the world in 1984',\n",
       " ' . Such were the adventures, there’s even an Apple+ film “Tetris,” starring Taron Egerton and directed by Jon Baird. Pajitnov smiles at the memory: “Noah Pink [the screenwriter] was very attentive to our notes, but it was still a long and difficult fight with them, because they desperately need all this Hollywoodish bullshit.”',\n",
       " ' Rogers understands the compromises necessary: “Their job was to take a year and a half of our life and squeeze it into two hours. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any control on the shooting, because of COVID.”',\n",

       " ' “When we watched the movie, we were surprisingly pleased,” Pajitnov says. “We had low expectations. I’m pleased with the bad guys. They’re fictional though.”',\n",
       " ' The very real-life British tycoon Robert Maxwell as Rogers’ main competitor also features along with Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, as the licensing battles took place against the backdrop of the changing situation in the USSR. “I like the actor who plays me [Nikita Efremov],” Pajitnov adds. “He reminds me of myself young. It was a strange, out of body experience.”',\n",
       " ' “I was there during the transition,” Rogers says. “We had a group of 100 graphic developers in Moscow working. I remember giving a speech. I said, this is not the end of the Soviet Union. This is the beginning of Russia. Everybody had hoped that it was going to be freedom. Then it slowly eroded back into what it is now.”',\n",
       " ' The reason for “Tetris’” success is simple according to Rogers: “We broke through the female barrier. Before ‘Tetris,’ games were for guys, 95% guys, right? And ‘Tetris’ changed all that.”',\n",
       " ' Rogers continues: “It’s an order out of chaos game and that is more the female side of us. Men are male and female. We are x and y. Women are x and x. We can do both construction and destruction. Women are construction and construction. That’s why the world is becoming a better place because of women.”',\n",
       " ' Looking at the current gaming market, both men have their criticisms. For Rogers, an ex-publisher of games, it’s economics. “People don’t want to spend the amount of money to buy a cup of coffee for a game. It’s $3 and a cup of coffee gives you 20 minutes of satisfaction, a game will give you hours.”',\n",
       " ' Talking about in-app purchases, Rogers continues the coffee comparison: “They give you this much coffee, and they ask for more money to put a little flavor into your coffee, or sugar. It’s such an annoying way of consuming something.”',\n",
       " ' “I’m still in love with my puzzle part,” Pajitnov says, but he finds current programs too full of bugs. “They’ll release a game, online or mobile games, and get the public to debug it. Then the game fails because people get annoyed.” He concludes with a resigned laugh: “It’s the dialectic.”',\n",
       " ' Rogers on the other hand is spending his energy now on combating climate change. “It’s called Blue Planet Alliance. We are basically putting Hawaii on a path to go 100% renewable energy. Fifteen other states copied us. It’s moving across the states. We’re bringing island countries to Hawaii to show them what we did and put them on track. Eventually, we’ll get all the countries in the world to have a mandate for 100% renewable energy by 2045, the 100th anniversary of the United Nations.”',\n",

Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.

      "\u001b[31m- . Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they’re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n",
      "\u001b[31m- While the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n",

      "\u001b[31m- . What's the final word on internet providers in Las Cruces?\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Your home broadband options will be limited if you reside in Las Cruces. Most households in the city are serviceable for a cable connection from Xfinity. Like most cable providers, expect a price hike from Xfinity once the promo period ends. A fixed wireless connection from T-Mobile might be a decent alternative to avoid that increase. Starlink is available virtually everywhere, but you might have to settle for slower speeds and a steeper monthly cost (to say nothing of the $349 upfront cost for starting service)\n",
      "\u001b[31m- . Internet providers in Las Cruces FAQs\n",
      "\u001b[31m- What is the best internet service provider in Las Cruces? Xfinity is the best internet service provider in Las Cruces, offering the city's fastest speeds, broadest coverage and lowest introductory prices. According to the latest data from the FCC, Xfinity is available to over 99% of households in Las Cruces, which means that your address is likely eligible for service\n",
      "\u001b[31m- . Is fiber internet available in Las Cruces? Yes, according to the latest FCC data, fiber internet is available to approximately 4% of Las Cruces households. Fiber coverage is limited throughout the city, but few households might be serviceable for Quantum Fiber or Xfinity's fiber internet connection\n",
      "\u001b[31m- . What is the cheapest internet provider in Las Cruces? Xfinity is the cheapest internet provider in Las Cruces, offering a $20-a-month plan for 150Mbps. For just $15 more, you can bump up that speed to 300Mbps.\n"

      "\u001b[0m As “Tetris” celebrates 40 years of falling blocks at the Lucca Comic and Games convention in Italy, Variety sat down with its creator Alexey Pajitnov and the Tetris company’s co-founder Henk Rogers to discuss the beginnings of the most successful computer game in the world\n",
      "\u001b[31m- . Despite the difference in their appearance, Pajitnov, pale with a white beard, and Rogers, tan with a colorful trilby, make a formidable team who overcame great odds to bring their puzzle game – in which players pair and eliminate a series of multicolored falling blocks – to the world in 1984\n",
      "\u001b[0m  . Such were the adventures, there’s even an Apple+ film “Tetris,” starring Taron Egerton and directed by Jon Baird. Pajitnov smiles at the memory: “Noah Pink [the screenwriter] was very attentive to our notes, but it was still a long and difficult fight with them, because they desperately need all this Hollywoodish bullshit.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Rogers understands the compromises necessary: “Their job was to take a year and a half of our life and squeeze it into two hours. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any control on the shooting, because of COVID.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Popular on Variety\n",
      "\u001b[31m- “When we watched the movie, we were surprisingly pleased,” Pajitnov says. “We had low expectations. I’m pleased with the bad guys. They’re fictional though.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- The very real-life British tycoon Robert Maxwell as Rogers’ main competitor also features along with Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, as the licensing battles took place against the backdrop of the changing situation in the USSR. “I like the actor who plays me [Nikita Efremov],” Pajitnov adds. “He reminds me of myself young. It was a strange, out of body experience.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- “I was there during the transition,” Rogers says. “We had a group of 100 graphic developers in Moscow working. I remember giving a speech. I said, this is not the end of the Soviet Union. This is the beginning of Russia. Everybody had hoped that it was going to be freedom. Then it slowly eroded back into what it is now.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- The reason for “Tetris’” success is simple according to Rogers: “We broke through the female barrier. Before ‘Tetris,’ games were for guys, 95% guys, right? And ‘Tetris’ changed all that.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Rogers continues: “It’s an order out of chaos game and that is more the female side of us. Men are male and female. We are x and y. Women are x and x. We can do both construction and destruction. Women are construction and construction. That’s why the world is becoming a better place because of women.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Looking at the current gaming market, both men have their criticisms. For Rogers, an ex-publisher of games, it’s economics. “People don’t want to spend the amount of money to buy a cup of coffee for a game. It’s $3 and a cup of coffee gives you 20 minutes of satisfaction, a game will give you hours.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Talking about in-app purchases, Rogers continues the coffee comparison: “They give you this much coffee, and they ask for more money to put a little flavor into your coffee, or sugar. It’s such an annoying way of consuming something.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- “I’m still in love with my puzzle part,” Pajitnov says, but he finds current programs too full of bugs. “They’ll release a game, online or mobile games, and get the public to debug it. Then the game fails because people get annoyed.” He concludes with a resigned laugh: “It’s the dialectic.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Rogers on the other hand is spending his energy now on combating climate change. “It’s called Blue Planet Alliance. We are basically putting Hawaii on a path to go 100% renewable energy. Fifteen other states copied us. It’s moving across the states. We’re bringing island countries to Hawaii to show them what we did and put them on track. Eventually, we’ll get all the countries in the world to have a mandate for 100% renewable energy by 2045, the 100th anniversary of the United Nations.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Rogers talks about his next endeavor with the confidence of a man who has solved puzzles before.\n"

      "\u001b[0m As “Tetris” celebrates 40 years of falling blocks at the Lucca Comic and Games convention in Italy, Variety sat down with its creator Alexey Pajitnov and the Tetris company’s co-founder Henk Rogers to discuss the beginnings of the most successful computer game in the world\n",
      "\u001b[0m  . Despite the difference in their appearance, Pajitnov, pale with a white beard, and Rogers, tan with a colorful trilby, make a formidable team who overcame great odds to bring their puzzle game – in which players pair and eliminate a series of multicolored falling blocks – to the world in 1984\n",
      "\u001b[31m- . Such were the adventures, there’s even an Apple+ film “Tetris,” starring Taron Egerton and directed by Jon Baird. Pajitnov smiles at the memory: “Noah Pink [the screenwriter] was very attentive to our notes, but it was still a long and difficult fight with them, because they desperately need all this Hollywoodish bullshit.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Rogers understands the compromises necessary: “Their job was to take a year and a half of our life and squeeze it into two hours. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any control on the shooting, because of COVID.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Popular on Variety\n",
      "\u001b[31m- “When we watched the movie, we were surprisingly pleased,” Pajitnov says. “We had low expectations. I’m pleased with the bad guys. They’re fictional though.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- The very real-life British tycoon Robert Maxwell as Rogers’ main competitor also features along with Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, as the licensing battles took place against the backdrop of the changing situation in the USSR. “I like the actor who plays me [Nikita Efremov],” Pajitnov adds. “He reminds me of myself young. It was a strange, out of body experience.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- “I was there during the transition,” Rogers says. “We had a group of 100 graphic developers in Moscow working. I remember giving a speech. I said, this is not the end of the Soviet Union. This is the beginning of Russia. Everybody had hoped that it was going to be freedom. Then it slowly eroded back into what it is now.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- The reason for “Tetris’” success is simple according to Rogers: “We broke through the female barrier. Before ‘Tetris,’ games were for guys, 95% guys, right? And ‘Tetris’ changed all that.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Rogers continues: “It’s an order out of chaos game and that is more the female side of us. Men are male and female. We are x and y. Women are x and x. We can do both construction and destruction. Women are construction and construction. That’s why the world is becoming a better place because of women.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Looking at the current gaming market, both men have their criticisms. For Rogers, an ex-publisher of games, it’s economics. “People don’t want to spend the amount of money to buy a cup of coffee for a game. It’s $3 and a cup of coffee gives you 20 minutes of satisfaction, a game will give you hours.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Talking about in-app purchases, Rogers continues the coffee comparison: “They give you this much coffee, and they ask for more money to put a little flavor into your coffee, or sugar. It’s such an annoying way of consuming something.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- “I’m still in love with my puzzle part,” Pajitnov says, but he finds current programs too full of bugs. “They’ll release a game, online or mobile games, and get the public to debug it. Then the game fails because people get annoyed.” He concludes with a resigned laugh: “It’s the dialectic.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Rogers on the other hand is spending his energy now on combating climate change. “It’s called Blue Planet Alliance. We are basically putting Hawaii on a path to go 100% renewable energy. Fifteen other states copied us. It’s moving across the states. We’re bringing island countries to Hawaii to show them what we did and put them on track. Eventually, we’ll get all the countries in the world to have a mandate for 100% renewable energy by 2045, the 100th anniversary of the United Nations.”\n",
      "\u001b[31m- Rogers talks about his next endeavor with the confidence of a man who has solved puzzles before.\n"
